# Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure code quality, security, and best practices before committing code.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

- [ ] Data access is abstracted through repository classes
- [ ] Repository classes inherit from base repository
- [ ] No direct database access in service or API layers
- [ ] Proper separation between SQL and NoSQL repositories

### Service Layer

- [ ] Business logic is contained in service classes
- [ ] Services don't contain database queries
- [ ] Services orchestrate between repositories
- [ ] Proper error handling in service methods

### API Layer

- [ ] Endpoints only handle HTTP concerns
- [ ] Request/response validation with Pydantic
- [ ] Proper dependency injection usage
- [ ] Consistent error response format

### Dependency Injection

- [ ] Database sessions injected properly
- [ ] Services injected into endpoints
- [ ] Authentication dependencies used correctly
- [ ] No hardcoded dependencies

## üîí Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] JWT tokens validated properly
- [ ] Token expiration checked
- [ ] Proper role-based access control
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs validated with Pydantic
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (using ORM)
- [ ] XSS protection in responses
- [ ] File upload validation (if applicable)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented

### Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Database credentials in environment variables
- [ ] No internal errors exposed to clients

## üìù Code Quality Standards

### Type Hints

- [ ] All function parameters have type hints
